# Fluffy - Chat Application

Welcome to my ChatApp! ðŸ‘‹

Fluffy is a feature-rich chat application built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). The goal of this project is to provide users with a seamless and interactive chat experience. Whether you're chatting with friends, colleagues, or building communities, this application offers a simple and intuitive interface.

This project was developed to deepen my understanding of full-stack development, focusing on integrating real-time messaging features, handling user authentication, and creating a responsive UI.

Here are some pictures of the login page and the chat page.
